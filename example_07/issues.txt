can't show the google analytics, because I'm not authorized. 

able to run in geonetwork - as a view over the metadata 
	(hack to pass parameters)
	- this has the advantage that whenever the metadata changes (eg. because a harvester
	runs and changes the spatial extent) it's immediately updated.
	- and there's no static maintenance issues. 

on the fly translation (hitting geonetwork service) of metadata parameters to 2nd level categories

actually a lot of reformatting of titles and cleaning up with regexs

bootstrap for css styling (phil)

work with Natalia to get the land masses and water bodies into geonetwork 

hacks/fixes to geonetwork
	- to expose url parameters down to the xslt processor 
	- to fix geonetwork parameter classifier service, which was broken

the intial template designed by our SEO John Cuthbertson didn't really work so well . 
	long lists of water-bodies etc. and needed a lot of coordination and changes

trying to find a service that could generate the map. looked at geoserver, google maps, openlayers. 
	google maps api.
