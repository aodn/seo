- there's two sets of gmd:descriptiveKeywords

xpath -e '//mcp:parameterName/mcp:DP_Term/mcp:term/gco:CharacterString/text()' argo_profiles.xml


xpath -e '//gmd:descriptiveKeywords' argo_profiles.xml 2>&1 | less


- see how we can hit things, using '//' in the middle of an expression 

xpath -e '//gmd:thesaurusName//gmx:Anchor' argo_profiles_with_water_bodies.mcp  2>&1 | less
xpath -e '//gmd:thesaurusName//gmx:Anchor/text()' argo_profiles_with_water_bodies.mcp

(0) how to manage the water bodies  and land mass information collected by Natalia. 
	- encode it up as another xml dependency.
	- marked up some dummy records - for proof of concept purposes.


TWO ISSUES

(1) issue that there's no one-to-one correspondance between collection record and the views because
each collection has multiple parameters.
	- therefore need to make it parametezied (whether static or dynamic)



---
(2) issue that the water bodies, and land masses exist as a spread sheet, and are not 

1. add region (water bodies, land masses) as a keyword associated with each metadata record.
2. change indexing, so that these are added as region s added as an index
3. then use the search api, to get data, rather than the metadata record. 

This data should be placed in/associated with record in some way, rather remain for 
us to have to manage. 


alternatively parse it out of the keywords with xpath in some way

hits lucene - and gives the parameter names, keywords platforms etc.
